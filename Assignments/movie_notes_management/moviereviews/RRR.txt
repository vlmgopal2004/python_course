RRR (Roudram Ranam Rudhiram, or Rise Roar Revolt in English) is a high-octane saga of friendship, rebellion, and anti-colonialism. Directed by S.S. Rajamouli, it follows Ram (Ram Charan), a fiery police officer under British rule, and Bheem (Jr NTR), a Gond tribal warrior, as their paths cross in a fictional bromance-turned-revolution against the British Raj. With a ₹550 crore budget, it’s one of India’s priciest films, released on March 25, 2022, in Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, Kannada, and Malayalam. It’s streaming on Netflix (Hindi) and Disney+ Hotstar (Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam).
Plot
In 1920s India, Bheem (Jr NTR) seeks to rescue a young Gond girl kidnapped by British Governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his wife Catherine (Alison Doody). Meanwhile, Ram (Ram Charan), a loyal British officer, is tasked with capturing Bheem. Unaware of each other’s true identities, they form a deep bond after a dramatic bridge rescue. Their friendship is tested when secrets unravel, leading to jaw-dropping action, betrayal, and a united fight against colonial oppression, all wrapped in Rajamouli’s larger-than-life storytelling.


Positives

Jr NTR and Ram Charan’s Performances: The duo’s chemistry is electric, with Jr NTR bringing raw intensity as Bheem and Ram Charan delivering a layered, emotional Ram. Their action scenes (e.g., the interval tiger fight) and emotional moments (like the prison breakout) are show-stealers. Fans on X call them “fire and water” for their contrasting energies.
Rajamouli’s Vision: Rajamouli’s direction is a masterclass in spectacle, blending over-the-top action with emotional stakes. The film’s scale—think animals unleashed on British soldiers or a fiery chariot chase—is breathtaking.
Action and VFX: The action sequences, choreographed by Nick Powell, are mind-blowing, with the “Naatu Naatu” dance-fight, bridge rescue, and climax battle earning global praise. VFX by V. Srinivas Mohan hold up well for the budget, creating immersive set pieces.
Music and Cinematography: M.M. Keeravaani’s soundtrack, especially “Naatu Naatu” (Oscar winner for Best Original Song, 2023), is infectious and iconic. Senthil Kumar’s cinematography captures lush forests, grand palaces, and chaotic battles with vivid flair.
Global Impact: RRR broke barriers, winning over Western audiences and critics, earning a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes and 7.8/10 on IMDb. Its Oscar, Golden Globe, and Critics Choice wins for “Naatu Naatu” cemented its legacy.


Critical Reception

Ratings: Critics lauded RRR for its ambition and entertainment. It scored 95% on Rotten Tomatoes (239 reviews), 7.8/10 on IMDb, and high praise from outlets like Variety (“a blast”) and Roger Ebert (4/4). Some Indian reviews (e.g., India Today, 3.5/5) docked points for pacing.
Box Office: RRR grossed ₹1,387 crore worldwide, becoming India’s third highest-grossing film. It smashed records in Japan and the U.S., with fans flocking for re-releases in 2024–25.
Audience Buzz: On X, RRR is a cultural phenomenon, with fans calling it a “cinematic masterpiece” and “Naatu Naatu” a global anthem. Some critique its length or over-the-top moments, but the love for Jr NTR, Ram Charan, and Rajamouli dominates.


RRR is a cinematic juggernaut—wild, emotional, and unapologetically bold. Jr NTR and Ram Charan’s powerhouse performances, Rajamouli’s audacious direction, and “Naatu Naatu”’s infectious energy make it a must-watch. Despite minor flaws like pacing and thin villains, it’s a global crowd-pleaser that redefined Indian cinema’s reach. Catch it on Netflix or Hotstar for a rollercoaster ride or revisit it in theaters for the full experience.
