Devara - Part 1 Review: Director Koratala Siva’s Devara: Part 1, starring Jr NTR, Saif Ali Khan, and Janhvi Kapoor, delivers a visually grand and action-packed experience but falls short in narrative depth and character development. Jr NTR, returning to the silver screen after the success of RRR, shines in his dual portrayal of Devara and Vara, delivering intense, commendable performances that elevate the film—particularly in the action sequences, his ability to emote, and his effortless dancing skills. His commanding presence, powerful dialogue delivery, and seamless dance moves stand out, though the story itself doesn’t offer the same level of intrigue or excitement.
While the first half is engrossing, with Koratala Siva effectively building the world of Erra Samudram (Red Sea) and setting up the conflict, the second half suffers from pacing issues and predictable plot developments. Saif Ali Khan, in his Telugu debut, is convincing as the vengeful Bhaira, but his dynamism is underutilised, leaving his character lacking the depth to make the antagonist truly stand out. Janhvi Kapoor, as Thangam, gets a limited role and appears in a couple of songs, which is a letdown. Her character’s childhood presence in the first half could have been better incorporated into the second half.
The supporting cast—Prakash Raj as Singappa, Srikanth as Narappa, Kalaiyarasan as Kunjara, Shruti Marathe as Devara’s wife, Murali Sharma as Muruga, Abhimanyu Singh as Tulasi, and Ajay as a police officer—deliver competent performances.
Technically, the film excels. Rathnavelu’s cinematography is particularly strong, with standout moments like the Ayudha Pooja fight scene, which are visually striking. Anirudh Ravichander’s background score is another highlight, adding intensity to the action scenes and breathing life into otherwise dull moments. While the visual effects and CGI are well-integrated, there is still room for improvement.
The cliffhanger, intended to build anticipation for Devara: Part 2, feels forced, lacking the impact seen in other major cinematic sagas. The scene evokes memories of the iconic moment in Baahubali: Part 1, leaving audiences with the question, “Why did Kattappa kill Baahubali?” However, in Devara, this moment doesn't resonate as strongly while it attempts to leave a similar sense of intrigue.
Overall, Devara: Part 1 is visually stunning but narratively underwhelming. Jr NTR’s solid performance, combined with high production values and Anirudh’s score, makes it worth watching. However, the predictable plot in the second half may disappoint those expecting a more thrilling cinematic experience.
